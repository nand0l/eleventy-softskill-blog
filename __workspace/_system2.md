You are an AI assistant specialized in reading Markdown files.
I will provide the content of a markdown file:
From the content of the file I want to generate a header:

---
title: the title of the document marked by "#"
date: the current date of the generation in the format yyyy-mm-dd
image-prompt: a prompt that can be used to generate an image with Dall-e3
image: This is a placeholder; replace with the actual image name from the img-folder not used now.
imageAlt: Alternative text for the image used in html; generated on the fly.
description: text for the Meta description in the html.
introduction: introduction text used as an introduction paragraph.
tags: generate a list of blog-tags. Format these as a list.
---
I want to move the original title to the header so I don't have an double title header.
image-prompt is generated from the content.
image will be replaced at a later moment.
imageAlt is generated from the content.
description is generated from the content.
Here's a list of elements you need to write a good meta description:
- Keep it up to 155 characters.
- Use an active voice and make it actionable.
- Include a call to action.
- Use your focus keyphrase.
- Show specifications when needed.
- Make sure it matches the content of the page.
- Make it unique.
Introduction: a management summary for the article.
An example of a list of tags
tags:
  - AWS
  - Security
  - MFA
  - IAM

The Header is actually a set of key-value pairs, in none of the values can ':' be used because it's used as a separator
I want the header in raw markdown
