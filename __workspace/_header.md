## introduction

Welcome to a concise guide on some of the fundamental terms and concepts in the realm of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. As these technologies continue to shape our world and future, understanding the basics becomes crucial. Dive in to unravel the layers of this technological marvel.

### **AI (Artificial Intelligence)**

AI is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart”. Think of it as the grand vision of machines that can mimic human intelligence.

---

### **Machine Learning (ML)**

This is a subset of AI. Instead of programming a computer to perform a specific task, you feed it data and it learns patterns from this data. For instance, if you show it pictures of cats and not-cats, over time it learns to recognize what makes a cat a cat.

---

### **Deep Learning**

A subfield of ML. It's inspired by the structure and function of the brain, specifically the neural network. Imagine it as a multi-layered net that processes data.

---

### **Neural Network**

These are algorithms designed to recognize patterns. They interpret data through a kind of machine perception, labeling, and clustering of raw input.

---

### **LLM (Large Language Models)**

Like me, ChatGPT! It's a type of deep learning model that's trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. It's why I can chat with you and provide information on a wide range of topics.

---

### **Training**

The process of teaching a machine learning model to recognize patterns using a dataset.

---

### **Dataset**

A collection of data that is used to train or test a machine learning model. For example, a collection of photos of cats and dogs to train a model to distinguish between the two.

---

### **An analogy**

Think of it like this: If AI is the universe of "smart" machines, Machine Learning is a galaxy within that universe, Deep Learning is a solar system within that galaxy, and Neural Networks are planets within that solar system. LLM, like ChatGPT, is a specialized type of planet designed for language tasks.
