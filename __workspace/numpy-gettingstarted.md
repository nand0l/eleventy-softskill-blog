# Getting started ML python quickstart

NumPy brings the computational power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use. With this power comes simplicity: a solution in NumPy is often clear and elegant.

## Installing NumPy with pip

When using `pip`, itâ€™s good practice to use a virtual environment. [See Creating Virtual environments](https://blog.skillsoft-demo.net/blog/python-virtenv/)

you might want to update pip to the lates version with: `C:\codeexample\myenv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip`
Where your virual environment `myenv` is created in the folder `C\:codeexample`

If you use `pip`, you can install `NumPy` with:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

`matplotlib` is used a lot in compbination with numpy, this can be installed with

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
