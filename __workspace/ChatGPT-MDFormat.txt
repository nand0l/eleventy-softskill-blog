Beginning **October 16, 2023**, *Amazon Machine Image Block Public Access (AMI BPA)* will be the default setting across **all AWS Regions**.

## What is AMI BPA?

AMI BPA is a new feature that restricts an AWS account from sharing an AMI with the public within a specific AWS region. As of now, this setting is disabled by default for all AWS accounts.

## Changes to Expect

From October 16, 2023, the default setting for AMI BPA will be changed to *enabled*. With this:

- All **new AWS accounts** will have AMI BPA enabled by default.
- This will also be the default for existing accounts which have **not shared an AMI publicly since July 15, 2023**.
- If you currently possess AWS accounts with public AMIs, this change **won't affect** them.

## What Does This Mean for You?

If your use-case demands the public sharing of AMIs, remember to:

- **Disable AMI BPA** for any new accounts created post the default change.
- Disable it for existing accounts that haven't shared an AMI publicly after July 15, 2023.

For those who don't require public AMI sharing, there's no need for any further action.
