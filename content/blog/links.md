## 🌍 Global Frameworks for Ethical and Trustworthy AI

Artificial Intelligence has inspired multiple **international frameworks** that aim to balance **innovation** with **ethical responsibility**.  
While some are **binding laws**, most function as **soft-law guidelines** shaping policy, regulation, and organizational practice.

### 🧩 Overview Table

| **Framework** | **Issuer / Origin** | **Legal or Guiding** | **Geographical Scope** | **Core Principles / Focus Areas** | **Influence / Use Case** |
|----------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|
| **OECD AI Principles (2019)** | Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) | **Guiding** (non-binding) | 46+ countries incl. EU & UK | Human-centered values, transparency, robustness, accountability, sustainable development | Adopted by **G20**, foundation for **national AI policies** |
| **Asilomar AI Principles (2017)** | Future of Life Institute (Beneficial AI Conference) | **Guiding** (non-binding) | Global, research-led | Safety, transparency, human control, shared benefit, alignment with human values | Influenced early **ethical discourse**; academic and NGO reference |
| **EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (2019)** | European Commission – High-Level Expert Group on AI (AI HLEG) | **Guiding** (soft law) | European Union | Lawful, ethical, robust AI; human agency; fairness; accountability | **Blueprint** for the **EU AI Act**; still used in EU ethics audits |

### 🏛️ OECD Council Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence (OECD/LEGAL/0449)

The **OECD Council Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence**, adopted in **2019** and revised in **2023–2024**, is the **first intergovernmental standard on AI**.  
It establishes the foundation for **trustworthy, human-centric AI** across 46+ countries, including **EU and UK** adherents.

**Type:** OECD Recommendation (soft law, *in force*)  
**Adopted:** 22 May 2019 · **Revised:** 8 Nov 2023 and 3 May 2024  
**Adherents:** All OECD Members + several Non-Members (e.g., Brazil, Singapore, Romania, Argentina, Saudi Arabia)  
**Purpose:** Promote a **human-centric, trustworthy AI** that respects the rule of law, human rights, and democratic values—while enabling innovation and international interoperability.

#### 🔹 Core Principles (for all stakeholders)

1. **Inclusive Growth, Sustainable Development & Well-Being**  
   AI should promote inclusive growth and environmental sustainability.

2. **Respect for Rule of Law, Human Rights & Democratic Values**  
   AI actors must uphold fairness, equality, privacy, human dignity, and labour rights.

3. **Transparency & Explainability**  
   Ensure stakeholders understand when and how AI affects them, and allow for challenge or review of AI-driven outcomes.

4. **Robustness, Security & Safety**  
   AI systems must function safely and be overrideable, repairable, or decommissioned if risks occur.

5. **Accountability**  
   AI actors are responsible for outcomes, ensuring traceability and systematic risk management across the AI lifecycle.

---

#### 🔹 Governmental Policy Recommendations (for Adherents)

1. **Invest in AI Research & Development** — Encourage public and private investment, open science, and bias-free open data.  
2. **Foster Inclusive AI Ecosystems** — Support data-sharing, infrastructure, and knowledge exchange.  
3. **Shape Interoperable Governance** — Develop agile, outcome-based, cross-border policy environments.  
4. **Build Human Capacity & Labour Readiness** — Equip people with skills, ensure fair transitions, and promote safe, high-quality jobs.  
5. **Strengthen International Cooperation** — Collaborate on standards, measurement indicators, and responsible AI governance.

### 🧭 Key Takeaways

- **Binding Law:**  
  - The **European AI Act** is currently the only **legally enforceable regulation**.

- **Soft-Law Guidelines:**  
  - **OECD**, **Asilomar**, **EU Ethics**, **NIST**, and **WEF** frameworks shape **policy and best practice** worldwide.

- **Geographical Relevance:**  
  - **EU:** AI Act (binding), AI HLEG & OECD (guiding)  
  - **UK:** OECD & NIST (guiding)  
  - **Global:** WEF & Asilomar (voluntary, shared ethical basis)

### 🎯 Discussion Questions

1. How do soft-law frameworks influence the creation of binding AI legislation?  
2. Why is international alignment crucial in AI ethics and governance?  
3. In your view, should ethical guidelines remain voluntary — or become legally enforced?
