Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale. API developers can create APIs that access AWS or other web services, as well as data stored in the AWS Cloud. As an API Gateway API developer, you can create APIs for use in your own client applications. Or you can make your APIs available to third-party app developers.

## API Gateway creates RESTful APIs that

- Are HTTP-based.
- Enable stateless client-server communication.
- Implement standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

For more information about API Gateway REST APIs and HTTP APIs, see Choosing between REST APIs and HTTP APIs, Working with HTTP APIs, Use API Gateway to create REST APIs, and Creating a REST API in Amazon API Gateway.

## API Gateway creates WebSocket APIs that

- Adhere to the WebSocket protocol, which enables stateful, full-duplex communication between client and server.
- Route incoming messages based on message content.
