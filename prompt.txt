# AMI Block Public Access now enabled for all new accounts and existing accounts with no public AMIs

Amazon EC2 has enabled the Amazon Machine Image Block Public Access (AMI BPA) setting by default for all new AWS accounts and all existing AWS accounts that have not owned a public AMI since July 15, 2023. AMI BPA restricts an AWS account from accidentally sharing an AMI publicly within an AWS Region, which helps improve the security and privacy posture for customers.
Previously, AMI BPA was disabled by default for all AWS accounts. With this change, AMI BPA will be enabled by default for all new AWS accounts. Additionally, AMI BPA has also been enabled for all existing AWS accounts that have not owned a public AMI since July 15, 2023. If you need to make an AMI public, you can disable AMI BPA by using the AWS CLI, SDKs, or Console. This change will not impact existing AWS accounts with public AMIs.
This change has been made in all AWS Regions, including the AWS GovCloud (US) Regions and Amazon Web Services China Regions.

## What is AMI BPA?

AMI BPA is a new feature that restricts an AWS account from sharing an AMI with the public within a specific AWS region. As of now, this setting is disabled by default for all AWS accounts.

## Changes to Expect

From October 2023, the default setting for AMI BPA will be changed to *enabled*. With this:

- All **new AWS accounts** will have AMI BPA enabled by default.
- This will also be the default for existing accounts which have **not shared an AMI publicly since July 15, 2023**.
- If you currently possess AWS accounts with public AMIs, this change **won't affect** them.

## What Does This Mean for You?

If your use-case demands the public sharing of AMIs, remember to:

- **Disable AMI BPA** for any new accounts created post the default change.
- Disable it for existing accounts that haven't shared an AMI publicly after July 15, 2023.

For those who don't require public AMI sharing, there's no need for any further action.
